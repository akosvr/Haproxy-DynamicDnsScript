# DynamicDnsScript
1. Replace the desired target domain, and the command that you want to run when address changes.
2. Install dependencies
  dns, dns.resolver, time, os
3. Run the script and be happy.
4. If you can't quit use pkill -f python-script-name.py

NOTE: I highly suggest you to run this script for example in a screen session.
